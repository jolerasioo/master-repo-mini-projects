# OpenAI Function Calling feature
This is a repository to play with OpenAI Function Calling. The goals are:
- Create the necessary tools (functions) to interact with a structured DB
- Compare performance against LangChain
- Familiarize myself with OpenAI and 3rd party tools
  - OpenAI Function Calling
  - Python libraries: [openai-functools](https://github.com/Jakob-98/openai-functools/tree/main)
